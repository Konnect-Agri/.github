# Konnect Odisha - Konnect-Agri

Samagra, with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is working with the Government of Odisha to improve the income of farmers in the state. It intends to do this by making the markets work for the farmers and by enabling the agri-value chain to operate at a higher equilibrium. To this end, the program aims to reduce information asymmetry and increase the choices available to farmers.
